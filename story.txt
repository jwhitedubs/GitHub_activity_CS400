  On the first day of school, little Bill woke up extra early. He was excited for his first day of 
middle school and the anticipation overweighed his desire to sleep. It was still significantly early,
though, so Bill crept down the stairs in a menacing fashion, hoping not to wake his parents up. To his 
suprise, his parents were already downstairs sitting at the kitchen table. With an excited look on her
face, Bill's mom made it seem like she was waiting to tell Bill some miraculous news. If Bill only knew
what was in store for him on that early Monday morning...
  Bill's mom told him to sit down because she had something exciting to tell him. Bill cautiously sat down 
and listened to his mom as she explained how his math teacher Mrs. Smith had won the lottery and quit her
job! She then said that the school had called and ask her to be a subsitute teacher until they could find
a perminate replacement! Bill sat there in shock trying to wrap his head around the fact that his mom would
be at his first day of middle school. Next thing he knew he was sitting in the passanger seat of his mom's 
car as she pulled into the middle school parking lot...
