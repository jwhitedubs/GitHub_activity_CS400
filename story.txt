  On the first day of school, little Bill woke up extra early. He was excited for his first day of 
middle school and the anticipation overweighed his desire to sleep. It was still significantly early,
though, so Bill crept down the stairs in a menacing fashion, hoping not to wake his parents up. To his 
suprise, his parents were already downstairs sitting at the kitchen table. With an excited look on her
face, Bill's mom made it seem like she was waiting to tell Bill some miraculous news. If Bill only knew
what was in store for him on that early Monday morning...

"Bill, we need to talk" his mother said excitedly. "As you know, your dad and I are the greatest superheroes in the entire city.
However, that didnt happen overnight. When your father and I reached our first day of middle school, our parents put us through The Trial."
"What's The Trial?" asked Bill. "It's different for everyone, all ypu need to know is that you should go pack a bag with an extra pair of clothes and some snacks. Come back down when you are ready." Bill ran up the stairs and eagerly packed his bag. When he rushed back downstairs he found hos mom and dad waiting for him in the superhero outfits. " ALl right son", said Bill's dad, "I am going to teleport you to the location of The Trial, so shut your eyes and dont open them until you feel you feet land on solid ground." Bill nodded and shut his eyes tightly. Bill heard a loud crash and felt his feet slam into solid ground. Bill opened his eyes and couldn't believe the sight before him.
